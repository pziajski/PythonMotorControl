# Description
This project is for a class called Engineering Technology & Design. It will be used to 
change motor speed and direction, as well as provide an emergency stop and reset 
functionallity. The program will interface with a LabJack UE9 and set output values, which 
will be connected to a circuit that will be used to power the said motor. The program will 
be varying voltages across certain ouputs and turn those outputs either on or off. A GUI 
will be made for simple user interaction.

# Requirements
* Python 3.7.2
* Any python IDE (in my case I will be using Anaconda Spyder as it is the requirement)
